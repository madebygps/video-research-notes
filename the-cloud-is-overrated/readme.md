## Intro notes

- I found that 1.6 millon figure [here](https://www.inc.com/sean-kim/how-tech-startups-can-crack-code-of-cloud-infrastructure-costs.html#:~:text=According%20to%20a%202020%20study,to%20the%20other%20enormous%20costs.)
    - ~100 employees
    - Relevant https://hackernoon.com/how-cutting-cloud-costs-can-help-startup-fundraising
- "Still recommendeds a certification to learn how to use it properly" tbf it's not that hard to get a cert and some of the technologies used in the demo also have certifications. 
- "how did we get to the point where we need sme for setting up services in the cloud" I think a lot of this is due to cloud being seen intitially as an OPS thing, it's just now that devs are realizing they need to know how to use it.
- "We've become too dependenrt on cloud providers without good reason" I agree but this only works for a subset of cloud customers. Enterprises will always need cloud providers. Startups (certain series) are more focused on growth than caring about their cloud bill. Everyone in between is where this talk is aimed at and personal projects.

## Demo notes

- The demo is fantastic and I'm going to start encouraging people to build something similar to learn. It has Bash, networking, CICD, Docker, Swarm, and more. 
- That being said, there's a lot in here that I gurantee the average web dev doesn't know. So when it comes to spending time to learn something, would you rather learn this or learn how to use a cloud provider? 
- "I'm not saying you should never use the cloud" I think this is the most important part of the talk. There are a lot of people who think that the cloud is the only way to go.
    - if you're looking for a job it'll probabbly be easier to find one if you know how to use a cloud provider
- However! the majority of skills learned in the demo are transferable to cloud providers. Remember the cloud is linux + networking +  scripting/programming + devops.
- The demo is aimed to not be multi region so it cannot be compared to cloud providers.

## Conclusion notes

- Great points made, avoid unnecesary abstractions. I really like this tip. The deeper you get into your career the further down the abstraction layer you should go. Also if you're a beast at setting up IaaS you have a great future.
- For personal projects this is great!
- In conclusion I think the presents opportunities: be cost mindful and be someone who can save a company cloud costs and be someone who knows the abstracted services and tools.
